intro: >
  Welcome to {MadSuite} website!
  Our mission is to deliver optimization software with state-of-the-art GPU acceleration.
  The performance of GPU-accelerated optimization solvers is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14236">successfully demonstrated</a> on the AC optimal power flow problems, optimal control problems, and other large-scale nonlinear optimization problems.
  For large-scale problems, using GPU acceleration often enables more than an order of magnitude speed-up, as demonstrated with the performance of ExaModels.jl and MadNLP.jl running on GPUs along with CUDSS compared to the state-of-the-art tools on CPUs for solving large AC optimal power flow problems.

  MadSuite is a suite of open-source optimization software encompassing algebraic modeling systems, optimization solvers, linear solvers, and domain-specific modeling libraries.
  Our software tools are embedded in the {Julia Language}, which is host a variety of excellent libraries for optimization, such as {JuMP.jl} and {JuliaSmoothOptimizers}, as well as extensive support for GPU programming, such as {CUDA.jl} and {KernelAbstractions.jl}.
  We employ the latest advancements in GPU computing, such as NVIDIA's {CUDSS} library, to provide high-performance solutions for large-scale nonlinear optimization problems.
